The recent release of the book about the Aarushi murders goes into great details about the case. Her death, the death of the help in the house and the subsequent case and trials. Within the narration of the details is the implicit search for where the system failed.

While looking at this kind of detailed map of one murder, I wonder if it will be useful mapping other murders. Perhaps murders that do not get as much detailed attention as this one.

I suppose I could be less lazy and do the data journalism required to map all these other murders and categorize them by caste and location and put them all on a pretty map to see what emerges. But we already know don't we? The murders that get ignored repeatedly are the murders taking place in the non-urban spaces. Where the brutal burning of children by immolation doesn't warrant an investigation or even empathy from the politician. Much less books about the incident with detailed maps of where the petrol was thrown in, which petrol bunk they bought the petrol from and so on.

Is the reason for this mere economics? Perhaps. There is particular media which covers certain kinds of stories for their target or intended audience. The media that covers things like the Aarushi murder, Indrani Mukherjea and all kinds of other juicy, scandalous murders like that gives us something more than just murder, it gives us entertainment. The fact that we can relate to families like that. Families from a certain socio-economic strata, aspirational. Working hard toward surving, securing the future of their children and acquiring all the symbols of success that is required to be a member of that strata. It is exhausting! Movies and television that describe the reality of other places gets so drab and disconnected. Where are the reality shows that depict the reality of this struggling aspiring class? Perhaps thats what these murders are. They are like a reality show murder mystery. Whodunnit with reality, not some fake reality concocted in some warped artist's mind. But true reality. The real. 

Compared to that, what are the lives of some dalit boys sleeping peacefully in their home. Burned alive with their parents beside them unable to help or rescue them. Who cares about the plight of those parents who've seen their children die before their eyes. Who wonders if the shrieks of their children keeps them up at night, unable to sleep. Not us. Not the urban, middle and upper-middle class. The people living in such small homes subject to being attacked is not a reality we face and perhaps is why we can't empathize? Perhaps that is why we don't care?
